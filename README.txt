<Problem Statement:Bluetooth Messenger>------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features implemented:

1.Interactive User Interface based on Google's material design.
2.Scanning & searching of Bluetooth devices in app.
3.Connecting & pairing of Bluetooth devices(Works on almost all devices,some debugging required).
4.Option to connect to a new device (new chat button).
5.chatting between two devices.
Note:in some devices(SONY smartphones mainly) the scan for new devices Button is not displayed.We regret that
and are trying to fix it.If this happens on your device too,connect pair your devices manually via bluetooth in
settings and then launch the app.It would show the required device name in the list.Otherwise,you can scan using
the app. 
Extra features implemented from our side:
1.voice typing by using google voice api.
Note: This feature requires internet connection on some devices(depending on your device). In some cases, the 
app crashed on pressing the cancel button in google voice recognition window.We are trying to fix it using 
try-catch.
Key UI features:
1.floating action button
2.splash screen 

Features to be implemented[most probably :) ] :
1.sending contacts
2.sending photo
3.profile picture
4.chat bubble using 9 patch image concept.
